Welcome to [**Inspira UI**](https://inspira-ui.com), a community-driven project for [Vue](https://vuejs.org)!

This collection offers beautifully designed, reusable components, taking inspiration from the amazing work done on [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com). While I'm not officially affiliated with Aceternity UI, I did receive permission from its creator to adapt his fantastic designs for the Vue ecosystem.

### About Inspira UI

Inspira UI is **not** a traditional component library. Instead, it's a curated collection of elegant components you can easily integrate into your applications. Simply pick what you need, copy the code, and customize it to fit your project. The code is yours to use and modify as you like!

### Why Inspira UI?

This project began to fill a gap in the Vue community for a similar set of components. Inspira UI brings the beauty and functionality of Aceternity UI to Vue, making it easier for developers to build stunning applications.

### Key Features

- Completely [free and open source](https://github.com/rahulv-official/inspira-ui)
- Highly [configurable](/components/all) to meet your design needs
- A wide range of [components](/components/all) to choose from
- Optimized for mobile use
